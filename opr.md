There has been a significant increase in OA journal Open Peer Review (OPR) since 2017 (‘Trends in Open Peer Review: Research by Information Scientists’ n.d.) which is an indicator of at least the popularity of OPR.

> The question for a guide publication is how can OPR be beneficial - for a publication that is free to use, seeks reuse, and looks to be practically effective in the  uptake of a working practices in citiizen science - for example by incorporation into a training programmes?

OPR is as varied or possibly even more varied as conventional peer review. For example here is a database of journal OPR policies 'Transpose'. (‘Transpose A Database of Journal Policies on Peer Review, Co-Reviewing, and Preprinting’ n.d.) Another example is 'Reimaginging Review' which catalogues innovations in OPR. (‘ReimagineReview – A Registry of Platforms and Experiments Innovating around Peer Review.’ n.d.) A useful source for OPR practice is ASAPbio a US non-profit preprint and peer review agency who are innovators and a community hub for there open research practices. (‘#FeedbackASAP: Growing Preprint Review’ n.d.)

What is OPR? In different ways OPR as it say 'open peer review' is about making the review process open. This can be about complete tranparency for example the publisher eLife  has the process open including the editor decision letter, (Giridharan et al. 2022) or a process can be about 'post publishing review', (‘Open Post-Publication Peer Review’ n.d.) or about community engagement for example with The Turing Way. (‘Community Handbook — The Turing Way’ n.d.) OPR has gained accendance primarily because of the reproducibility and replicability crisis in science, but its use has other applications for improving a scholarship, research, and publishing.

## Open Access Guides

It is worth noting that open access guides tend to be neglected in terms of properly applying open licences and using other publishing enhancements; DOIs, PIDs, reusable and interoperable formats. See the notes on this question in the following blog post. Learning to Make Collaborative Guides with Open Access. Generation R. 2021 https://doi.org/10.25815/QHPM-3N49

## OPR for the Citizen Science Guide for Research Libraries

### Our current process

#### What is the publication

 - Topic is approached to be a practical guide to enable library staff to support projects, researchers, and the public in citizen science practice
 - A four section multi-format open access book, released as a series and then collated as one volume.
 - Each section is approximately 8-11 thousand words, with high a quality graphic layout
 - Published on Github cs4rl.github.io/guide/
 - Using enhanced open access and open sciece publishing practice: LOD, interoperable formats, OA, FAIR, open citations, etc

#### Who contributes

  - Editorial Committee (section editors): Paul Ayris (Chair), Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, Jitka Stilund Hansen, and Kirsty Wallis 
  - Co-Editors-in-Chief: Thomas Kaarsted & Simon Worthington 
  - Reviewers: Two persons per section
  - LIBER Citizen Science Working Group members optionally review or comment
  - LIBER office contributes comments
  - Post publishing peers are approached for feedback

#### What is the current review process

  - Initial sections topics set by WG following LIBER CS recommendations paper
  - New sections arrise from conversations with memebers and partners
  - Section editor appointed (brief given from Editors in chief)
  - Section editor creates an ideas and authors table of contents
  - Meetings follow to develop ideas and article list - 2 weeks
  - Section editor commission articles - 2 months
  - Articles go out for peer review - 2 weeks
  - Review process does not yet have detailed steps or processes: Current process is reviewer is asked for two things for the purpose of ensuring the chosen topic is adequequately covered: summary of key issues as a bullet pointed text; to comment inline on review points. 
  - Editor in chief then creates a plan of action to address reviews
  - Post publishing peers are approached for feedback
  - Hypothesis is on the site for comment
  - A Github issue tracker is open for comment
  - Participation in open science community event to solicit feedback: e.g., Open Science Barcamp 8th March 2022.

### What do want from the OPR process

  1. We need to actively design a process that will benefit: content ideas and quality; reuse of content; design of the format for learning outcomes; improve enhanced publishing technical quality.
  2. Make sure that reviewers are given a better structure for reviewing
  3. That reviewers are trained or give supportive instruction
  4. That post publishing feedback is solicited on content and presentation
  5. Feedback is sought of publishing organisation of process and technical quality for reuse - especially thinking about reuse in other training porgrammes or platforms
  6. How to make all stage of the process open, while being sensitive to reviewers and authors, and being productive for the publication and the citizen science community
