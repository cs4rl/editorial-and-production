There has been a significant increase in OA journal Open Peer Review (OPR) since 2017 (‘Trends in Open Peer Review: Research by Information Scientists’ n.d.) which is on indicator of the increase in the use of OPR.

OPR is as varied or possibly even more varied as conventional peer review. For example here is a database of journal OPR policies 'Transpose'. (‘Transpose A Database of Journal Policies on Peer Review, Co-Reviewing, and Preprinting’ n.d.) Another example is 'Reimaginging Review' which catalogues innovations in OPR. (‘ReimagineReview – A Registry of Platforms and Experiments Innovating around Peer Review.’ n.d.) ASAPbio, as US non-profit preprint and peer review agency are innovators and a community hub for there open research practices. (‘#FeedbackASAP: Growing Preprint Review’ n.d.)

What is OPR? OPR has gained accendance primarily because of the reproducibility and replicability crisis in science.
