## Section and article authoring

### Article editing

#### Peer review

  * Carry out review process
  * Once reviews complete, collate and summarise main review issues: To ensure issues are addressed, and pass up other issues for later consideration or use in another area like introductions, new sections, etc.
  * Process main review points into finished texts

#### Editing

  * Revisions can be used to make snapshots: See File, Save revision
  * Ensure overall article coherence.
  * Clear up any comments and commit any Track Changes.
  * Apply style guide: Title, intro, author, picture cations, citations, infoboxes.
  * Check article settings in Fidus: Settings, Language, British English.
  * Add DOIs, if missing (raise issue and assign to Simon Worthington).
  * Add images if needed: Each article needs a featured image. Riase an Issue if no image available.
  * Use in-built spelling checker in Fidus Writer: Tools, Spelling/Grammar, Check text. Right Click on hightlighted words for suggestions. Clear markings in Tools menu.
  * Preview PDF for additional proofing if required: This is not in the final layout presentation, but instead still as word processor.
  * When article has completed the editing steps, it is considered to be a Final Draft and can go to proofing.

#### Proofing

  * Pass article to at least one other editor. Once proofed the article is Final Proofed Draft. After this individual proofing of the article, the article will then be proofed again in the complete layout by the editorial group, working group, and section editor.
